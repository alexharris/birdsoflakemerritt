                        Lake Merritt is home to the nation's first official wildlife refuge, founded in 1869 on the edges of the then-small town of Oakland, California. In the intervening years, as Oakland has grown to fully encompass the water's edge, Lake Merritt has provided respite for birds and humans amongst it's waters and grassy circumfrence.
                    </p>
                    <p><i>Birds of Lake Merritt</i> is a book that tells the history of this lake, the relationship between the birds and humans that share it, and introduces us to fifteen species that can be regularly seen on or around it's waters.</p>

This charming book is the perfect introduction to the lake and its birds, and it’s sure to give you a new appreciation of both.”

                        “With brush and words, Alex Harris brings out the local color of beloved birds in the heart of Oakland. Through each bird’s backstory, we see that Lake Merritt is a meeting spot for local avian residents and international travelers alike. Alex’s bird portraits capture the life, whimsy, and identification details of fifteen common species, making this a great introduction to birds for adults and youth.”
